<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am presently serving as a lecturer at the University of Information Technology, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City. 
- As an undergraduate, I focused on social media text mining under the mentorship of [Dr. Kiet Van Nguyen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kiet-Nguyen-14) and [Assoc. Prof. Ngan Luu-Thuy Nguyen](https://dblp.org/pid/174/4407.html).
- During my master's studies, I had the privilege of being supervised by [Prof. Sakriani Sakti](https://hai-lab.naist.jp/profile/ssakti/index.html), where I delved into zero-resource speech processing and speech-to-speech translation. This work sparked a profound interest in linguistics and motivated me to explore this field further.

Currently, I am passionate about leveraging AI to preserve and revive endangered languages. Also, my research is centered on the automatic generation of data to address the challenges of limited resources.

I am also <span style="color: #FF8C00; font-weight: bold;">exploring the possibility of enrolling in a Ph.D. program</span> in the Spring of 2025.
